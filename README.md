## Overview
- This is the dotfiles repo where I keep my system configuration.
- My daily driver OS is Arch Linux (Endeavour OS) and my editor of choice is Neovim.
- Sneak peek of my setup below:

## How can you apply my dotfiles?
- If you want to replicate my `dotfiles` setup on your Linux machine, first install the necessary tools, then place the configuration files from my repository into your `~/.config/` folder.
- The main goal of this setup is to encourage explorationâ€”browse the documentation for the tools and plugins included, then choose the ones that best fit your workflow or simply inspire you the most.
